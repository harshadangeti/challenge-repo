A library is an institution that collects, organizes, 
and provides access to information and resources in various formats, 
including books, digital media, and databases, for a defined community to use for reference, 
research, and borrowing. They serve diverse communities, from public libraries to those within schools, 
universities, or companies, and may exist as physical buildings or virtual spaces. Key library services include managing collections, 
providing access to information, and assisting users with their needs through librarians and information professionals.
